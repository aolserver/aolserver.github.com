We are pleased to announce the availability of AOLserver 4.5.1.  This
release is mostly a bug-fix and maintenance release, and offers enhanced
functionality and scalability and improved documentation and
portability. AOLserver compiles with Tcl 8.4.\* and 8.5.\*.

The most important changes are:

* improved behavior under high load, when running out of resources 
* better interface to Tcl I/O functions through providing access to Tcl file handles (allows asynchronous delivery) 
* built-in version of ns_cache backward compatible with the old (now obsolete) aolserver module. 
* various fixes for the build process 

For more information on the changes in this version please refer to the release notes and ChangeLog in the source distribution.

* Michael Andrews 
* Jim Davidson 
* Nathan Folkman 
* Tom Jackson 
* Gustaf Neumann 
* Jeff Rogers 
* Bas Scheffers
