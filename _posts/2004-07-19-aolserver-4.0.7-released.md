On behalf of the AOLserver Team, I have the honor of announcing the
latest point release of AOLserver: 4.0.7. 

This version is primarily a bug fix release following version 4.0.6.  A
summary of changes is provided at the end of this document. 

NOTE:  This release corrects a serious flaw in 4.0.6 where a
non-compliant HTTP/1.1 request can crash the server, resulting in a
Denial of Service.  Everyone is urged to skip the 4.0.6 release and
either remain on 4.0.5 or upgrade to 4.0.7 immediately. 

### WHAT IS AOLSERVER? 

AOLserver is America Online's Open-Source web server.  AOLserver is the
backbone of the largest and busiest production environments in the
world.  AOLserver is a multithreaded, Tcl-enabled web server used for

### CHANGES SINCE LAST RELEASE? 

Fix bug where internal redirect for 401 omitted including the HTTP 
auth.  "WWW-Authenticate:" header.  Fixes bug #674033. 

Ns_GetAddrByHost() reports errors via Ns_Log(), so calls to it 
should be done after Ns_Log has been initialized, otherwise very 
unhelpful error messages are produced.  In particular, this happens 
when the server is started and the hostname as returned by 
gethostname() cannot be resolved, because the network interface is 
down AND no entry exists in /etc/hosts.  Closes SF Bug #868362. 

Setting request->method to static storage, which later gets 
ns_free()'d in Ns_FreeRequest(), causes the server to crash.
