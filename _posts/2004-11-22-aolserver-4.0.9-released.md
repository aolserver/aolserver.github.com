Announcing the release of AOLserver 4.0.9.  AOLserver is a
multithreaded, Tcl-enabled, massively-scalable and extensible web server
tuned for large scale, dynamic web sites.  AOLserver also includes
complete database integration and a dynamic page scripting language.  

The source is freely available from the sourceforge.net site at:  

[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3152](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3152)  

For more information on the changes in this version please refer to the
ChangeLog in the source distribution.  A high level summary of the
changes follows: 

Bugfixes: a shutdown crash fix; a memory leak when using getaddrinfo; a
server hang fix for ns_http; bad invocations of
ns_schedule_{proc,daily,weekly} proc can crash the server; omit
Content-Length header if ADP streaming is on; Ns_ConnSend() now does
what the docs say it does. 

Enhancements: a new Ns_Compress() to gzip data; a new
Ns_SockCancelCallbackEx() to correctly cancel callbacks; enable writing
of corefiles on Linux after setuid by setting PR_SET_DUMPABLE.
