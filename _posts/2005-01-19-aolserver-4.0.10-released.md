Announcing the release of AOLserver 4.0.10.  AOLserver is a
multithreaded, Tcl-enabled, massively-scalable and extensible web server
tuned for large scale, dynamic web sites.  AOLserver also includes
complete database integration and a dynamic page scripting language.

The source is freely available from the sourceforge.net site at:

[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3152](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3152)

For more information on the changes in this version please refer to the
ChangeLog in the source distribution.  A high level summary of the
changes follows:

This release adds two enhancements and one API change.  The major
enhancement is the adding of configurable transparent gzip compression
of HTTP responses from ADP pages.  The minor enhancement is the addition
of a numeric version #define to aid conditional compilation of modules
that require specific AOLserver versions or must be compiled differently
depending on the version.  Ns_Compress() has been renamed to
Ns_CompressGzip() in anticipation of other algorithms which will be
supported.
